The contents of this directory represent unfinished experiments, still in need
of some serious work.  If they at least work to specification on Linux, they
might get moved into src/, although ideally I would at least like them to work
to spec on FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD and maybe even ancient SVR4 first.

I will accept improvements, provided you:
  1. disclaim copyright and place them in the public domain
  2. assign me the copyright
  3. explicitly allow me to use the code under the terms of ../license.txt.

In any case, unless you would prefer NOT to receive credit, a note will appear
in the source code immediately below my own copyright notice and above the
license terms.

My current contact point is usotsuki at buric dot co (Feb. 2, 2023).
